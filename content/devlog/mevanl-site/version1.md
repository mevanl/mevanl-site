## Tech stack

## FastAPI
I am experienced in using Django and Flask when it comes to python libraries for backend and I did not want to use express, node, react, etc. since I felt that were too much for this level of project. I wanted to learn FastAPI since I know it is new and gaining lots of popularity. I have found it to be very intuitive to learn and I the seperation of backend api and server itself is amazing in my opinion. 

## Hosting
After purchasing my domain from porkbun, I decided to use Google Cloud to host since I have used it before with a lot of success and I find the free tier quite generous. I will be able to host this site pretty much forever completely for free with it. All I needed to make was a simple github action to automatically rebuild the deployment from a Dockerfile and I do not ever have to worry about it again.
